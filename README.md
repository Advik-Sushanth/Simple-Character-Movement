# Simple-Character-Movement

-- Introduction -- 

This repository features a simple character movement for the player in a game I am currently developing. The game is still in a [BETA] phase and will improve over time! 

-- Setup --

1. Add the C# Scripts inside your assets folder in the unity editor
2. Add an empty game object and add the player model / shape (i.e., cylinder / cube / sphere / capsule, etc.)
3. Add the script to the player as a component
4. You're done and ready to go! Test out the movement and if there are any errors re - check if everything is set up correctly
